Setup Instructions

    Bot Token: Add your bot token to the .env file by pasting it after token=your_token_key.

    MySQL Configuration: In the .env file, you will find fields for host, user, password, database, and port. Update these fields with your MySQL database information. This database is used to store the secret key for your guild.

    Secret Key: To securely store your secret key, the example uses a MySQL database. If you want to hardcode your secret key instead, you can replace instances like guildSecretResult[0].secret_key in the code with your actual secret key. Remember to make this change in each .js command that requires the secret key.

    Console Log: Modify the console log message after login in the ready.js file. Update the line console.log(successfully logged in as ${client.user.tag}!); with your desired log message.

Usage

Once you have set up the bot according to the instructions above, you can invite it to your Discord server and start using the commands. Each command performs a specific action related to the Aurora API.
